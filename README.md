# StudyWorm
Webapp to help those book worms be more efficient and diligent with their studies.

Our application - the Study Worm - is a multi oganization and planning tool to help keep up with both one's personal study schedule and encourage them to keep up with each subject they are lacking time for to keep up with them better.

We went about thinking of an application with basic and simple uses and functions to help organize and motivate someone using it for what many would consider daunting tasks, homework and studying.

Our aproach was frist to find the simple things within our current skill set and porject objective to use. We came to the conclusion of utilizing: the use of a map, a timer for studying in sections or personally determianed goals, and an API for videos to add to the over all studying experince. 



In the application we used:

a time

a map

different APIs for: video and maps
